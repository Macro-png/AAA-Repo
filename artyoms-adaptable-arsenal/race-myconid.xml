            <p>Silent and ever-growing, myconids spread through the release of spores, giving rise to clusters of fungi—some of which mature into sentient beings. Their forms vary wildly, from tiny sprouting caps to towering fungal guardians. Bound by an unseen network, they communicate in hushed spores, forming tightly woven colonies that thrive in the deep, damp places of the world.</p>
            <h4>MYCONID TRAITS</h4>
            <p>As a myconid, you have the following racial traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Plant.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Small or Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fungal Form.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and resistance to poison damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can read, understand, and write Common and Undercommon. You cannot speak it.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Pheromone Spores.</em></strong> Myconid sprouts learn to bathe threats in scented spores on sight so older and stronger members of the circle can track and destroy them. You can use a bonus action to cover one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you with those spores. For 1 minute, you and all other myconids and spore servants have advantage on attack rolls against that creature. You can fire those spores a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of once) and regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Rapport Spores.</em></strong> The creature can communicate telepathically with any creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The creature and the target must share a language, and the target must have an Intelligence of 2 or higher and not be an undead, construct, or elemental.</p>
