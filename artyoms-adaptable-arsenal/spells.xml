            <p>You create a loop with your fingers and peer through it, magically magnifying your sight. While concentrating, anything you can see viewed through the loop appears twice as large.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell’s magnification increases to four times at 5th level, eight times at 11th level, and sixteen times at 17th level.</p>

            <p>Spectral chains lash out from you. Each creature of your choice in a 15-foot emanation originating from you must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 2d4 force damage and is pulled 10 feet closer to you. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and is not pulled.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

            <p>You twist the perceptions of those around a creature, causing all others to see it as an immediate threat. Choose one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, all other creatures that can see the target regard it as hostile for the duration.</p>
            <p class="indent">Creatures are not compelled to attack the target, but they instinctively perceive it as an enemy and will prioritize it in combat. Furthermore, the affected creature automatically fails any ability check to interact socially with other creatures and any creatures charmed by the target immediately end that effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each time the target takes damage, it can repeat its saving throw againt this spell, ending the effect on a success.</p>
            <p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a 7th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.</p>
