# Artyom’s Adaptable Arsenal

Ah, you found my notes. Good. These pages hold everything I’ve cobbled together—spells, devices, tricks, and the odd tattoo that hums with arcane power. Some are mine. Some… well, I just “borrowed” them from other hands less careful than mine.  

If you’re reading this, you’re either an adventurer with too much curiosity, or a Dungeon Master with too little sense. Either way, welcome.

## 📖 What You’ll Find
- **Spells**: Chains that drag, whispers that magnify, and other arcane experiments.  
- **Subclasses**: Rogues who dig where they shouldn’t, wizards who etch magic into their very skin.  
- **Backgrounds**: Stories of those displaced by time and those who wander it freely.  
- **Magic Items**: Relics of ages past, and more than a few bits of Riftech—delicate, unstable, and entirely unsafe.  
- **Rules Galore**: Because what is a game without bending the rules a little?
